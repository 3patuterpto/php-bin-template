## Step 1: Download and Install Facegen Modeller 31 Full 17
 
The first step is to download and install Facegen Modeller 31 Full 17 on your computer. You can get the software from the official website or from other sources. Make sure you have enough disk space and system requirements to run the software smoothly.
 
## Step 2: Launch Facegen Modeller 31 Full 17 and Choose a Mode
 
Once you have installed the software, launch it and choose a mode from the main menu. There are three modes available: PhotoFit, SketchFit, and Freeform. PhotoFit allows you to create a face from one or more photos of a person. SketchFit allows you to create a face from a sketch or a drawing. Freeform allows you to create a face from scratch using various tools and sliders.
 
## Step 3: Import or Create a Face
 
Depending on the mode you chose, you will need to import or create a face. For PhotoFit mode, you will need to import one or more photos of a person's face from your computer or camera. The photos should be clear, frontal, and well-lit. You can also use the built-in camera feature to take a photo directly from the software.
 
For SketchFit mode, you will need to import a sketch or a drawing of a face from your computer or scanner. The sketch should be clear, frontal, and well-proportioned. You can also use the built-in sketch feature to draw a face directly on the software.
 
For Freeform mode, you will need to create a face from scratch using various tools and sliders. You can start with a random face or choose from a library of preset faces. You can then adjust the shape, skin, hair, eyes, and expression of the face using the sliders on the right panel.
 
## Step 4: Edit and Refine the Face
 
After you have imported or created a face, you can edit and refine it using various features and options on the left panel. You can use the tools to move, rotate, scale, and deform the face. You can use the modifiers to apply different effects and filters to the face. You can use the symmetry to make the face more balanced and realistic. You can use the morphs to blend the face with other faces or change its age and gender. You can use the expressions to change the emotion and mood of the face.
 
## Step 5: Export and Save the Face
 
When you are satisfied with your face model, you can export and save it in various formats. You can export the face as an image file (JPG, PNG, BMP) or as a 3D model file (OBJ, STL, FBX, DAZ). You can also save the face as a project file (FG) that you can reopen and edit later on Facegen Modeller 31 Full 17.
 
Congratulations! You have just created your own realistic 3D face using Facegen Modeller 31 Full 17. You can now use your face model for various purposes, such as animation, gaming, art, education, and more.
